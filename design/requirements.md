#Design requirements for PeARS

## Website

Give the website a consistent look! We'd like to keep the current logo, so the
rest should 'fit in'. The current scheme does not work properly on smartphones,
so this should be checked too.

Things we might want:

* A news section on the front page (for instance, we still don't have anything
 saying anywhere that we got the Mozilla funding...)
* Perhaps a blog section, where we could report news in more depth, etc?
* We should all update our bios if needed. Could we perhaps try to have them
 all roughly the same length, so that the whole thing is aesthetically
 pleasing? :)


## PeARS GUI

* General appearance of search module.
* More specifically, work on personalisation of returned pears in the results
 page.
* GUI for the indexer: we may need to have a bit of a public survey on this...
 What would people like? (I've already had people telling me they'd want a tree
 design, where they would be able to click on some pear-looking objects to
 select their shareable topics...)

## General branding

* What exactly do we need?
* Do we want to already have some basic material ready for Cambridge? (Stickers
 or something...)
* We need catchy slogans (to put on the stickers!)
