# Minutes from 09.04.2016
### Attendees: Behrang, Aurelie

## State of to-do list
* PR #40 is still waiting to be tested. Behrang will install the relevant branch and play with the new code. 
* The website looks good and just needs Behrang's and Veesa's profiles. Behrang will update his directly.

## WWW conference
Hopefully, some cool people will be at WWW. Perhaps we can find some partners to set up a ICT2020 application to the EU?

## Academic chat
Behrang and Aurelie had a long chat about vector spaces. Behrang is to devote his life to random indexing methods because they're so cool. He's built some vectors that get rho=0.75 correlation on the MEN dataset, so very good stuff. The discussion turned to what to do when we want to change the PeARS semantic space. Inevitably, this means re-calculating all vectors in the system. We could store co-occurrence frequencies over the system and build the vectors on the fly, but this basically would mean storing the whole Web on the PeARS network, so perhaps not an option.
