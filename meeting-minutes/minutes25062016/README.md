# Minutes of 25.06.2016

Attendees: Aurelie, Behrang, Hrishi, Nandaja, Shobha. Guest: Bharat.

## Items to discuss

* General news:
 Aurelie and Behrang had the PeARS evaluation paper accepted at the STARSEM 
 conference in Berlin. Shobha is thinking of writing her PhD proposal on PeARS.

* Organise Mozilla funding:
We're waiting for the money. When it comes, Aurelie will transfer team support,
design and server funds to Indian team. The design fund will be used for the
website, the GUI, and general branding. Aurelie to email Hrishi with
requirements so he can talk to Orion.

* State of DHT:
Nandaja has a kickass plan for implementing the DHT. The intuition is that it 
will be like Torrent without file sharing. Behrang is excited about the local
sensitive hashing part of it. Aurelie gets lost and requires some
documentation. Nandaja says she will write a description.

* Cambridge update:
What can we offer for the Cambridge workshop? Cambridge people want open source
stuff because of theme of the workshop. Behrang suggests splitting PeARS
into several talks. Hrishi could give a talk on Digital Humanities --
specifically about how social media influences language change. Veesa to talk
about GitHub?

* Security query on old repo?
We need a security expert on the team. We only have half-baked answers to such
queries. Perhaps not top priority, but to keep in mind. Hrishi has a friend he
could ask for help.

* Behrang and Aurelie re. open vectors:
Shall we have a store of freely available vectors somewhere? We wanted to link
up with Dmitri at MIT about the possibility to 'share meanings' in a distributed
way. Behrang says, what we should do is perhaps forget about static vectors and
have a function produce them on the fly from the word string. Aurelie doesn't
like the idea because she feels the system would then revert to a traditional
VSM with symbolic word meanings (i.e. there is no way to know that 'cat' and
'kitten' are more similar than 'cat' and 'eagle'). Aurelie promises to write
her thoughts on this on the PeARS discussion board, so that everybody can form
an opinion.

* Gerben:
Aurelie never wrote back to Gerben and feels bad about it.
